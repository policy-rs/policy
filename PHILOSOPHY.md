# Policy Philosophy

- KISS - Keep it Super Simple and keep making it simpler (as possible)
- a single line and short as possible
- Source of Truth is implemented in Code in this repository
- Express the specifics in the code and leave the high level in spec
- Use new alphanumerics if the existing meaning changes
- Alphanumeric can be either Value Assignment OR Self-Expression
- No specs for anything that is not needed Now(tm)
- Don't be afraid of breaking changes and use SemVer
- Don't be afraid of the Regex - be expressive with it - less words more regex
- Make something up in the meanwhile - rather than analysis-paralysis
- Don't sweat it.
